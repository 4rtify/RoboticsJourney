    "1. **PRML Model**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: PRML stands for \"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.\" It encompasses techniques and algorithms used for recognizing patterns and building machine learning models.\n",
    "   - **Components**: \n",
    "     - Selecting features\n",
    "     - Choosing algorithms\n",
    "     - Training on labeled data\n",
    "     - Fine-tuning parameters\n",
    "     - Evaluating performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation in PRML**:\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Critical for model performance. Includes tasks such as:\n",
    "     - Data cleaning\n",
    "     - Handling missing values\n",
    "     - Scaling/normalizing features\n",
    "     - Encoding categorical variables\n",
    "     - Splitting data into training and testing sets\n",
    "   - **Goal**: Ensure the model is trained on reliable and representative data to build an accurate and generalizable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classification vs. Regression**:\n",
    "   - **Classification**: Predicts discrete categories or labels (e.g., spam vs. not spam emails).\n",
    "   - **Regression**: Predicts continuous numeric values (e.g., predicting house prices based on features like area and location).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Supervised vs. Semi-Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning**:\n",
    "   - **Supervised Learning**: Trains on labeled data with known outputs. Goal: Learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.\n",
    "   - **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Uses a small amount of labeled data with a larger amount of unlabeled data to improve performance.\n",
    "   - **Unsupervised Learning**: Learns patterns and relationships without explicit output labels. Common tasks include clustering and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generative vs. Discriminative Models**:\n",
    "   - **Generative Models**: Learn the underlying distribution of the data and can generate new samples. Examples: Naive Bayes, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).\n",
    "   - **Discriminative Models**: Focus on learning the decision boundary between classes. Examples: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **False Positive and False Negative**:\n",
    "   - **False Positive**: Incorrectly predicts a positive outcome when the actual outcome is negative.\n",
    "   - **False Negative**: Incorrectly predicts a negative outcome when the actual outcome is positive.\n",
    "   - **Implications**: Varies based on the context, such as medical diagnoses or spam detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Precision and Recall**:\n",
    "   - **Precision**: Ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions made. Indicates the accuracy of positive predictions.\n",
    "   - **Recall**: Ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positive cases. Measures the model's ability to identify positive cases correctly.\n",
    "   - **Use**: Particularly useful in cases of class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **F1 Score**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. Provides a balance between precision and recall, especially in imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "   - **Formula**: $ F1 = 2 \\times \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\times \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Confusion Matrix and Correlation Matrix**:\n",
    "   - **Confusion Matrix**: A table showing the performance of a classification model with counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.\n",
    "   - **Correlation Matrix**: A table displaying correlation coefficients between multiple variables, used to understand feature relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Classification Report**:\n",
    "    - **Definition**: A summary of a classification model's performance, including precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.\n",
    "    - **Purpose**: Provides a comprehensive view of model performance across different classes, accounting for true positives, false positives, and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
