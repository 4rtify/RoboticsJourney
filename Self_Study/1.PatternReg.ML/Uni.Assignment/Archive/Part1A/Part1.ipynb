    "## 1. Why the Problem is a PRML Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The breast cancer detection problem qualifies as a Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (PRML) problem due to the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Recognition Design Steps:**\n",
    "- **Problem Definition:** The task is to classify breast scans into malignant or benign categories. This involves recognizing patterns in the scan features that correlate with the malignancy of tumors.\n",
    "- **Feature Extraction:** Relevant features are extracted from the scan data, such as mean radius, texture, and perimeter. These features serve as inputs for the machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "- **Model Training and Testing:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets. A model is trained on the training set to learn the patterns and is evaluated on the test set to measure its performance.\n",
    "- **Model Validation:** Validation techniques ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data, which is crucial for its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- **For Patients and the Medical System:** Automating tumor detection using a machine learning model can enhance accuracy, reduce diagnostic errors, and expedite the process, potentially leading to better patient outcomes and more efficient medical practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Pipeline:**\n",
    "- **Data Collection:** Obtain and preprocess breast scan data.\n",
    "- **Feature Extraction:** Identify and extract relevant features from the scans.\n",
    "- **Model Selection:** Choose appropriate machine learning models.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Involvement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Recognition:**\n",
    "- **Pattern Recognition Involvement:** The task involves identifying patterns in breast scan features that distinguish malignant tumors from benign ones. The pattern recognition aspect focuses on extracting meaningful patterns from the data to make accurate classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning Design:**\n",
    "- **Supervised Learning:** This problem is a supervised learning task, where the model learns from labeled data (i.e., scans with known malignancy status) to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "- **Model Training:** Machine learning algorithms are trained to recognize the patterns in the features that are indicative of malignancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. ML Algorithms to Investigate\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "- **Suitability:** Logistic Regression is suited for binary classification problems and provides probabilities for class membership. It works well if the relationship between features and the outcome is approximately linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Support Vector Machines (SVM):**\n",
    "- **Suitability:** SVM is effective for classification tasks, especially when the data is not linearly separable. It finds the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes.\n",

    "- **Suitability:** GBM builds models in a stage-wise manner, improving performance through iterative optimization. It is effective for capturing complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning:**\n",
    "- These algorithms are chosen because they handle classification problems effectively and can accommodate both linear and non-linear relationships in the data. They also offer various ways to deal with potential overfitting and model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Why the Project Qualifies as a PRML Problem\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Relationship Exploration:** The relationship between features and the outcome may be linear or non-linear. Visualization and statistical analysis are used to determine the nature of these relationships.\n",
    "- **Model Choice:** Depending on the linearity of the data, parametric models (like Logistic Regression) or non-parametric models (like Deep Neural Networks) may be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-Time and Computational Requirements:**\n",
    "- **Real-Time Implementation:** For practical applications, the model must be optimized for real-time performance, especially in clinical settings where timely results are crucial.\n",
    "- **Computational Complexity:** The choice of model will depend on the computational resources available and the complexity of the data.\n",
