    "**Abstract** - This project explores the Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn, focusing on identifying key features to build a predictive model. I applied techniques from prior coursework on exploratory data analysis, leveraging new tools and insights. My approach emphasizes thorough data exploration, including feature correlation, visualizations, and statistical methods, to better understand the dataset. This assignment serves as both a technical exercise and a career exploration opportunity. The model aims to predict malignancy using machine learning techniques from sklearn, guided by visualization, expert resources, and AI assistance to enhance workflow efficiency and understanding of feature importance."
